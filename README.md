# Ma Cuisine

## Project Overview

Building a recipe-styled website showcasing various recipes using an API. 

## Motivation

I am not particularly a good chef, so I thought it could be a good opportunity for me to build something to motivate me to cook more and eat out less. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm start

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Tech/frameworks Used

Built with 

* React
* CSS

### Features

Nothing spectacularly different - very simple design with some animation from 'framer-motion'.

### Approach Taken

Initially started off by designing a mock-up and then proceeded to build out each component seperately and adding design throughout. 

### Difficulties encountered when building this

A few hiccups here and there due to typos and api integration.
